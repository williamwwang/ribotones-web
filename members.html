										<h4>Alto Saxophone | CSB</h4>
										<p>Matthew grew up in Lititz, PA, where he began playing the saxophone in fourth grade. In high school, Matthew played four years in concert band and marching band, serving as saxophone section leader in 11th and 12th grade. Additionally, Matthew began playing in PMEA county, district, and regional bands in 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, respectively. After putting aside music to focus on biochemistry at Penn State University, Matthew realized that he missed playing the saxophone and joined the MIT Concert Band and Ribotones during his second semester of graduate school.</p>
