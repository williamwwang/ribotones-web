As a pianist, she has appeared as concerto soloist with the Four Seasons Orchestra and received awards at statewide competitions. Her collaborative background includes accompaniment, chamber music, and orchestral concerts. At MIT, Austen is currently involved as clarinetist and pianist in the Chamber Music Society. Although her time is now mostly spent on math and machines, she's even more passionate about keeping music alive and thriving. Having seen the power of music to unite communities and transform people--from benefit concerts to impromptu performances--she's really excited to be a part of Ribotones!</p>
